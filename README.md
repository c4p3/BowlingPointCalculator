## Bowling point calculater

This is my attempt to build a bowling point calculator. 
To run it, you must use Java 11. 



## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management
I am using the jackson-annotations, -core, -databind and org.json libraries.
